      <h2>Types Of Pollution </h1>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <h3>
            <li>Land Pollution</li>
          </h3>
          <p>Land pollution is one of the most prominent and harmful types of pollution. It is the contamination of soil
            and other terrestrial land forms by chemical or solid waste products leading to degradation of the natural
            environment. Land pollution can beget other types of pollution propagating a vicious cycle which ultimately
            causes permanent damage to this planet. </p>
          <h3>
            <li>Water Pollution</li>
          </h3>
          <p>Water pollution is the infusion of toxic matter into water bodies like oceans lakes and dams or water ways
            like rivers and streams causing the area to become hazardous to the animal and plant life present. This has
            a devastating effect on the water cycle and can lead to severe problems as a result. Water pollution has
            harmful effects widely as most living organisms are heavily dependant on water for life.</p>
          <h3>
            <li>Air Pollution</li>
          </h3>
          <p>Air pollution is the introduction - directly or indirectly - of hygroscopic particles (solid or gas) into
            the atmosphere that reduces the quality of the air of an environment. Air pollution is heavily tied to
            the green house effect/global warming and ozone depletion which have disastrous consequences long term.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <li> Light Pollution</li>
          </h3>
          <p>Light pollution is the excessive use of artificial, lighting especially during the night hours. It is
            harmful because it can confuse the wildlife of an environment and cause damage to human sight. Excessive
            lighting disrupts
            the natural cycle and blocks view of the sky and stars. </p>
          <h3>
            <li> Noise Pollution</li>
          </h3>
          <p>Noise pollution is any disturbing or unwanted noises or loud sounds that interfere with or harms the human
            and wildlife population of an environment. Noise pollution is very harmful as it can lead to hearing loss
            and affect the circadian rhythm of organisms. Noise that is over 85 decibels is detrimental to health and
            noise louder than this for long periods is hazardous. </p>
          <h3>
            <li>Thermal Pollution</li>
          </h3>
          <p>Thermal pollution is the release of heated or cooled water to an environment increasing the temperature of
            said
            environment. This negatively impacts the natives of the affected areas as those species are specifically
            adapted to survive in a certain temperature range and an increase or decrease can have a severe effect on
            them or even kill them. This is especially harmful when heated water is added to a ecosystem as hot
            water contains less oxygen then cooler water. </p>
          <h3>
            <li>Radioacive Pollution</li>
          </h3>
          <p>Radioactive pollution is the leakage of toxic chemicals and radioactive materials into an environment not
            equipped to handle it. This is potentially one of the most harmful, if not the singular most harmful, forms
            of pollution. It is typically caused by nuclear power plant malfunctions and each incidence is catastrophic
            with long lasting effects. Unlike other forms of pollution, radioactive pollution is not always easily
            identifiable adding to the danger. </p>
